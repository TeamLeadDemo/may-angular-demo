web application

	- had multiple pages in it
	- MPA 


front end application backend application

MPA - Multi page application

SPA - Single Page Application
	- the entire application has only one page
	- we manipulate the DOM of this page to make it dynamic
	- JS is the best choice to manipulate DOM
	- using plain vanilla JS is not feasible to manipuilate the DOM
	- here frameworks make it easier for us
	- we can use angular framework to create SPA
	- angular uses typescript, typscript is a super set of javascript

	- in order to work with angular we need to install angular/cli
	- to install angular cli we need npm(node package manager)
	- we get npm by installing node js

to check the verison of nodejs
	 node --version
to check the version of npm
	 npm --version
install angular/cli using npm, this will install the latest version of angular
	 npm install -g @angular/cli
check the version of angular installed
	ng version
we are now good to create an angular project in the cmd using the ng command, create a folder for your project
	ng new my-hello-angular
		choose y for angular routing
		choose CSS for stylesheet
now a new angular project is created, open this project in vscode
in cmd, navigate to the angular project folder and start the angular live developemnt server
	ng serve
