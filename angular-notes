to run the demo angular project in your local machine
----------------------------------------------------
    - clone the project to your local
    - this does not have the node_modules
    - but we need the node_modules to run the application
    - run the command "npm install" in the cmd and this will install the node_modules folder ( be inside the project folder)
    - this command will look into the package.json and install the node_modules

web application

	- had multiple pages in it
	- MPA 


front end application backend application

MPA - Multi page application

SPA - Single Page Application
	- the entire application has only one page
	- we manipulate the DOM of this page to make it dynamic
	- JS is the best choice to manipulate DOM
	- using plain vanilla JS is not feasible to manipuilate the DOM
	- here frameworks make it easier for us
	- we can use angular framework to create SPA
	- angular uses typescript, typscript is a super set of javascript
    - typescript files are saved with .ts
    - browsers never understand typescript, 
    - so typescript is transpiled to java script when the application is built

	- in order to work with angular we need to install angular/cli
	- to install angular cli we need npm(node package manager)
	- we get npm by installing node js

to check the verison of nodejs
	 node --version
to check the version of npm
	 npm --version
install angular/cli using npm, this will install the latest version of angular
	 npm install -g @angular/cli
check the version of angular installed
	ng version
we are now good to create an angular project in the cmd using the ng command, create a folder for your project
	ng new my-hello-angular
		choose y for angular routing
		choose CSS for stylesheet
now a new angular project is created, open this project in vscode
in cmd, navigate to the angular project folder and start the angular live developemnt server
	ng serve

- angular is all about components
- {{ }} string interpolation
    - we can render a property from the component.ts file into the template using string interpolation

- we are good to create our own components
- we are going to create a component DisplayComponent
- there are 4 files associated with a compnent
    <comp>.component.ts
    <comp>.component.html
    <comp>.component.css
    <comp>.component.spec.ts

- steps to create a component
    1) create the files for the component
    2) include the component in app.module.ts file
    3) use the component's selector

- 2 ways to create a component
    - manually create all the files - tedious
    - or could use the commmand ng generate component
            ng generate component display
            ng g c display
            this command will automatically make an entry in the app.module.ts

strong interview questions
-----------------------------

string interpolation {{ }} - we were able to render a property of the component in the template

property binding [] - we were able to bind a property of the component to the value attribute of the text box in the template

event binding () - we bind an event in the template to a function in the component class

one way property binding - the property in the component class is bound to the template and not vice versa
                        - we use {{ }} or []
two way property binding - the property int the component class is bound to the template and vice versa
                        - we use ngModel for 2 way property binding
                        - to use ngModel, we have to include FormsModule under the imports attribute of app.module.ts
                        - eg CounterComponent
angular routing
------------------
    - each component is provided a route path


    steps for routing with HeaderComponent
        1) provie a route path to each component in the app-routing.module.ts
        2) Create a HeaderComponent with anchor tags and place it on AppComponent
        3) specify the route path of the component when the anchor tags using routerLink are clicked
        4) specify the <router-outlet>
        5) use routerLink instead of href for anchor tags, we dont want the entire page to be reloaded from the server
        6) there is more to routing -  will discuss later

    3 ways to route to a component
        - directly type the route path in the url - we dont do this
        - use anchor tags with routerLink
        - use Router api



ngModel - creates a FormControl object

we can create form in 2 different ways
---------------------------------------
1) Template driven forms
    - we used this in the session
    - within the form tag each input element has a ngModel which creates FormControl object
    - This FormControl object holds the entire info about the input element
2) Reactive forms
    - we do not use ngModel here, instaed we create the FormControl object in the component class
    - more coding than template driven forms

Complete topics of Angular
--------------------------
    - Components
    - Directives( in built and custom)
    - Modules
    - Forms - Template or Reactive
    - Form Validations
    - Pipes(in built and custom)
    - HttpClient
    - routing with RouteGaurds
    - EventEmitters

Route Gaurds
------------
    - we are working with CanActivate Route Guard
    - create the guard using the command 
            ng g g users/authentication
    - write the logic for the guard
    - configure the guard for the components which needs login validation
    - for this in app.routing.module.ts file include these lines for the components which requires route guards
        { path: "display", component: DisplayComponent, canActivate: AuthenticationGuard] }
    - now we can test by trying to access the components without logging in
        - for this type the route path of the component directly in the url
