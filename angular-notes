web application

	- had multiple pages in it
	- MPA 


front end application backend application

MPA - Multi page application

SPA - Single Page Application
	- the entire application has only one page
	- we manipulate the DOM of this page to make it dynamic
	- JS is the best choice to manipulate DOM
	- using plain vanilla JS is not feasible to manipuilate the DOM
	- here frameworks make it easier for us
	- we can use angular framework to create SPA
	- angular uses typescript, typscript is a super set of javascript
    - typescript files are saved with .ts
    - browsers never understand typescript, 
    - so typescript is transpiled to java script when the application is built

	- in order to work with angular we need to install angular/cli
	- to install angular cli we need npm(node package manager)
	- we get npm by installing node js

to check the verison of nodejs
	 node --version
to check the version of npm
	 npm --version
install angular/cli using npm, this will install the latest version of angular
	 npm install -g @angular/cli
check the version of angular installed
	ng version
we are now good to create an angular project in the cmd using the ng command, create a folder for your project
	ng new my-hello-angular
		choose y for angular routing
		choose CSS for stylesheet
now a new angular project is created, open this project in vscode
in cmd, navigate to the angular project folder and start the angular live developemnt server
	ng serve

- angular is all about components
- {{ }} string interpolation
    - we can render a property from the component.ts file into the template using string interpolation

- we are good to create our own components
- we are going to create a component DisplayComponent
- there are 4 files associated with a compnent
    <comp>.component.ts
    <comp>.component.html
    <comp>.component.css
    <comp>.component.spec.ts

- steps to create a component
    1) create the files for the component
    2) include the component in app.module.ts file
    3) use the component's selector

- 2 ways to create a component
    - manually create all the files - tedious
    - or could use the commmand ng generate component
            ng generate component display
            ng g c display
            this command will automatically make an entry in the app.module.ts


string interpolation {{ }} - we were able to render a property of the component in the template

property binding [] - we were able to bind a property of the component to the value attribute of the text box in the template

event binding () - we bind an event in the template to a function in the component class

one way property binding - the property in the component class is bound to the template and not vice versa
                        - we use {{ }} or []
two way property binding - the property int the component class is bound to the template and vice versa
                        - we use ngModel for 2 way property binding
                        - to use ngModel, we have to include FormsModule under the imports attribute of app.module.ts
